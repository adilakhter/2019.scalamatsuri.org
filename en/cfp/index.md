Come share your stories at ScalaMatsuri 2019!

----

We are excited to announce that the fifth ScalaMatsuri will be held on March 16th (Fri), 17th (Sat), and 18th (Sun), 2018 at Tokyo International Exchange Center. Please submit your talk for the general sessions that will be held on 17th (Sat) or 18th (Sun). This CFP will be closed on **December 16th 23:59 JST**.

For your reference:[ScalaMatsuri blog](http://blog-en.scalamatsuri.org/)

Matsuri, meaning festival, is about time and space out of the everyday. Itâ€™s about mustering up the courage to do something cool (even though we are normally shy).
We want to make it a fun experience, regardless of gender, race, and many different backgrounds.
All participants, including speakers and sponsors, are asked to be respectful to each other and follow the [code of conduct](/en/code-of-conduct/).

In particular, we want to make it a fun event for those visiting Japan from overseas.
So here are some of the things we will do this year:

- CFP in English and Japanese < you are here
- Speakers will be decided using survey and social impact as a reference
- All slides in English
- Professional interpreters (English/Japanese bidirection) in two main halls
- Travel grant for speakers with most votes (See [travel grant](/en/cfp/#Travel-grant))
- We'll plan hangouts at bars after the conference if you're up for it

We are looking for topics that you think Scala community or new learners of Scala would be interested. We have three session length: 10 minutes, 40 minutes, and 90 minutes. Prepare an abstract of your talk (600 characters or less), and submit your proposal.

We'll conduct a survey on which talks your fellow Matsuri would want to go to,
and the organizers will decide the talks using the survey result and social impact as a reference.
In addition to the CFP, we might invite a few speakers to make Matsuri more fun experience.

You are allowed up to three submissions. However, please note that it might end up splitting your votes,
and that we'll ask you to select one talk even if multiple talks qualified via the survey.

### Travel grant


ScalaMatsuri wants diverse speakers from all over the world. To help break down the barriers, we're excited to offer travel grant.

Because ScalaMatsuri is run by a non-profit association, the travel grant must only be used for something that we can file as an expense. Here are the categories that is ok:

1. Airfare and other transportation to Tokyo.
2. Other transportation during ScalaMatsuri
3. Hotel fares during ScalaMatsuri general sessions. (three nights for March 16th, 17th, and 18th)

Any other expenses, including ones incurred from sightseeing or hotel fares (priced per person in Japan) for accompanying travellers, cannot be expensed by us.

We'll accept expense requests after ScalaMatsuri for a month. All items must have either an email forward from an airline or scans/photos of a receipt. If you need earlier financial support, we will do our best to accomodate you.

The maximum amount of the travel grant is fixed by the origin of your travel:

- Japan $800 USD
- [East Asia and Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_geoscheme_for_Asia) (China, Korea, Philippines etc) $900 USD
- Other Asia (India, Turkey, Israel, etc) $1500 USD
- Oceania $1300 USD
- Europe $1500 USD
- Africa $2000 USD
- North America $1500 USD
- South America $2000 USD

Note that the amount offered as travel grant will NOT exceed the actual travel expense.
Suppose you've been approved for the grant and the travel expense was $1000 from Europe, the maximum amount the ScalaMatsuri will reimburse will be $1000.

Your expenses will NOT be accepted in the event that you do not attend the conference. At the sole discretion of ScalaMatsuri, some expenses may be reimbursed upon a natural disaster, death or illness of the speaker or a family member. We suggest you purchase travel insurance if these terms are not sufficient.
