This talk will focus on practical examples to build intuition for writing purely FP programs, even if you don't 'get' it yet. I'll introduce Finally Tagless(FT) with some simple examples. We'll focus on the effectiveness of this pattern for program design. I'll talk through the usefulness of FT's abstraction and how constraining our types through typeclasses can produce readable, expressive, reliable and testable code.
