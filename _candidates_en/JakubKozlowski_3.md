In the beginning, there were only functions and data. Maybe it's enough?
We'll look at the advantages of pure functions and immutable data. Then, we'll go for an adventure of programming with only that, and see whether we're missing anything.
Hopefully, we'll see that it's entirely possible and reasonable to write programs that are:
- just as useful as the ones written with mutability, runtime reflection, dependency injection frameworks, side effects and exceptions
- much easier to test, parallelize, refactor and change than otherwise
by only using pure functions and immutable data types.
