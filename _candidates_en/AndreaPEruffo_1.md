Everyone has learned over the years to hate SBT enough, it's now time to stand and talk a little more about it.
Like any other library or tool we use in our daily work SBT deserve a little of principled learning, despite the fact most people try to keep the build working with some furious googling and copy-pasting this rarely turns out to be a proper solution.
There are a few(more or less opinionated) principles where SBT sit on, just learning a few basics will enormously boost our productivity, demystify the dragons in our build.sbt and, even, open us new horizons to leverage on it.
