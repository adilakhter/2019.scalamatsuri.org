KSAI by Knoldus is an open source library built on Scala. It uses Scala’s best features/libraries like Future & Akka actors to do the computing.
Besides making use of Scala’s best features, KSAI also makes optimum use of Scala’s collections in order to improve performance of ML applications upto 10x. In this talk we will share our experience of building fast Machine Learning applications on KSAI/Spark. KSAI is a well-developed ML library on Scala which is handy for data engineers, containing optimized algorithms for Neural Network, Association Rule, Decision Tree, and many more.
